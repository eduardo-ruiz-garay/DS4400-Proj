# Black Scholes Results and Analysis
I tried using the black scholes formula for tech companies APPL, GOOGL, and MSFT. Trading in the european union.
The main difficulty I found was getting a good gauge for the volatility. As in the last effort the changes where very much pointing towards the lower end then there was a massive increase. 
Having read a bit more I would go about it differently trying first to gauge what the market thinks is the stocks volatility as historical data is less of an indication. 
The idea would be to get historical calls and work backwards getting the volatility to a point where it is usable.

To run have to pip install the dependancies and the jupyter notebook.
